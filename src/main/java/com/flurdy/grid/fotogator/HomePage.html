		<h2>A holiday photo aggregator</h2>
		<hr/>
		Scene: You are on holiday (or any other event e.g wedding)
		with a group of people and everyone have taken different photos.
		And you want to share these amongst yourselves afterwards.
		<hr/>
		Problem 1: Different people use their prefered online photo sharing sites; e.g:
		<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com">Picasa web albums</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.coppermine-gallery.net">coppermine</a>, photobucket, Snapfish, etc.
		This resolves to many different, confusing, and often lost or ignored
		ways to share photos.<br/>
		Problem 2: Some people don't use online photo sharing.
		<hr/>
		Possible solution:
		To stop forcing people to change their provider,
		I want to create a sort of aggregator site for photo albums.
		On an event group page, people can add links to their 3rd party photo album.
		This way people can easily and quickly find each album.
		<hr/>
		Extras:
		<ul>
			<li>No photos stored on my application</li>
			<li>Tools to create and distribute login details to 3rd party</li>
			<li>Offer suggested 3rd party tools (problem 2)</li>
			<li>Link to a google group for chats, mailing list etc</li>
		</ul>
