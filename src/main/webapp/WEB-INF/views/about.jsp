	<p>
		A holiday photo aggregator is a tool to gather holiday photos in one place.
	</p>
	<p>
        By using <b>snaps</b>, people can share their photos with their fellow travellers.

	<p>
		People prefer different tools and websites to store their digital photos.
		Sharing this with the others often becomes a mess of email links, attachments, 
		several photograph hosting site invites, passwords, low quality, missing and duplicate photos.
		And some don't share due to ignorance or lack of ability to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>snaps</b> hope to address this by providing a tool to aggregate, ie collect and store, how to access these photos.
		<b>snaps</b> do not store these photos, it provides a central way to manage the links to photograph hosting sites,
		such as picasa, flickr, snapfish, photobucket, etc that the members choose to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		By combining the core functionality of access photos from different sources,
		<b>snaps</b> hope to provide tools to encourage interest in the event before it happens and
		tools to communicate and share news after it happened.
		In addition <b>snaps</b> will supply guides/suggestions on how to share photos.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this <b>snaps</b> hope to be very usefull for people as the one entry point
		to find out more about their upcomming and mostly their previous holiday(s).
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>snaps</b> was initially called fotogator, short for photograph aggregator<br/>
		Other suggested names was:
		PhotoGate, EventGate, SnapGate, TeamGate, SnapGrid, FotoGrid,
		TravelGate, SnapGroup, HoliGate...
